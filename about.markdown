# Nourished by Parisian dawn, and paleontologist’s dream, Alizée Freudenthal <br>is an awarded-designer from that faraway land of croissant and honey; <br>magnifique France.

# At the tenderest age of twenty, young Alizée boarded a railway train bound for nearby Belgium and Brussels, to an education in Visual Communication and Graphic Design. And a lovely paper declaration that forever reads, Alizée Freudenthal, Master Of Arts.

# Sweetest Belgium gave forth at last to Northern Italy and a fellowship with [*Fabrica*](http://www.fabrica.it/), United Colors Of Bennetton’s communications research centre. Here, where entrancing glasses of tangerine prosecco flow in endless succession, and long bicycle journeys are taken along canal’s banks by twilight, our Alizée created international works for clients such as [*Colors Magazine*](http://www.colorsmagazine.com/), Unesco and the Word Health Organisation.

# After two glorious years of Mediterranean creation, the time had come the old walrus sang for Alizée to voyage once more, westward bound, over the Atlantic to that land of liberty, that fabled metropolis of mythical imagining; New York City. And it was here, amidst the cherry blossoms and chrome subways, Far Rockaway and Long Island,  that young  Alizée made her winter’s nest, where she remains to this very day.

# Labouring then for several renowned agencies such as [*Mother Design*](http://www.motherdesign.com/), <br>[*Watson & Co.*](http://www.watsonnyc.com/), [*Be-Pôles*](http://be-poles.com/en/), [*2x4*](http://2x4.org/), and [*Pentagram*](http://www.pentagram.com/#/home), Alizée is now freelancing wherever she may, all across Gotham City, and abroad. When not lost deep in the wonderful worlds of grids, kerns and Pantones, Alizée spends many a contemplative hour wondering over the minutiae of human relationships and the forever pleasures of travel, experimenting with her crockpots, and examining the nomadic culture of the Tzigane, or lesser-known eastern European gypsy.

# Despite her most gallant efforts, Alizée’s Parisian tongue cannot quite yet <br>stay in her pocket. For she still suffers over pronouncing that most indispensable of English words; the skewer.
